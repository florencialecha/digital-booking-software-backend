## 🎯  Overview

📚 For 8️⃣ weeks, my 4️⃣ teammates and I immersed ourselves in the adventure 🚀 of developing our first application from start 🏁 to finish, completely from scratch.
🔍In this repository, you will find the application's backend software created by Florencia Lecha, along with details on why each technical decision was made and how the focus was kept on essential aspects:
- **Keep it simple and functional:** 🏆 MVP always working with constant increments. 
- **Taking care of the basics:** ✅ Good practices, code readability, clean architectures that make the business logic explicit.
- **Easily scalable and maintainable** without over-engineering (probably the most difficult challenge)🌟.
- **Have fun and improve:** 🔑 key to face the challenges we faced.

🎯We achieved a robust hotel booking platform 🏨 with a focus on creating a user-friendly experience and efficient business management.
In addition to this, we achieved a **solid and clean backend, following SOLID and Domain Driven Design principles** as well as a **unified frontend** at the style level and consistent at the code level and a continuous integration pipline that made it very easy for us to implement features.

Feel free to explore the [project's wiki](https://github.com/florencialecha/digital-booking-software-backend/wiki) for a deeper understanding of the development process and the decisions made throughout the creation of this hotel reservation application.
