## 🎯  Overview
📚 For 8️⃣ weeks, my 4️⃣ teammates and I immersed ourselves in the adventure 🚀 of developing our first application from start 🏁 to finish, completely from scratch.

👥**Squad:**
* **Damian Dell'Acqua -** Front-End Developer 💻
* **Rocky Montero -** Front-End Developer 💻
* **Manuel Godoy -** Testing 🧪
* **Ciro Rojas -** Infrastructure 🏗️
* **Florencia Lecha -** Back-End Developer 🔧

🔍In this repository you will find the application's backend software created by Florencia Lecha along with all the details, why she made each technical decision and how it was organized to keep the focus on what is important:
- **Keep it simple and functional:** 🏆 MVP always working with constant increments. 
- **Taking care of the basics:** ✅ good practices, code readability, clean architectures that make the business logic explicit.
- **Easily scalable and maintainable** without over-engineering (probably the most difficult challenge)🌟.
- **Have fun and improve:** 🔑 key to face the challenges we faced.

🎯In this sense, we achieved a robust hotel booking platform 🏨 with a focus on creating a user-friendly experience 😊 and efficient business management 📈.

💪 In addition to this, we achieved a **solid and clean backend, following SOLID and Domain Driven Design principles**🔐 as well as a **unified frontend** at the style level and consistent at the code level and a continuous integration pipline that made it very easy for us to implement features🚀.
